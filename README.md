# News Reader App

Android application that retrieves news data from https://news.ycombinator.com with the functionality to view them using WebView within the application. The request for a list of news can be made using 3 different filters; top stories, new stories, and best stories. A click on a specific news title launches the WebView loaded with the respective URL and a long click on specific news title shows a toast containing information about the owner of the article or story, and the unique ID provided by the API.

## Details
